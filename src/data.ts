  introduction:
    "There's only one kind of salad that i'll never complain about eating, heck, i'll gladly go on an African Salad diet and you won't hear a squeak for me. It is a delicious Igbo delicacy that's very easy to throw together and doesn't require a lot of ingredients. Here's how:",
  ingredients: [
    "2 Cups Abacha (Shredded Dried Cassava)",
    "1 Cup Ugba (Shredded Oil Bean Seed)",
    "Sliced Okazi (optional)",
    "1 Teaspoon Dried Efura/Ehuru",
    "1/2 Cup Palm Oil",
    "Sliced Onion",
    "2 Heaped Tablespoon Crayfish ",
    "Pottash (Akanwu)",
    "Cooked Ponmo (Optional)",
    "Dried Shrimps (Optional)",
    "Utazi Leaf (optional)",
    "Pepper",
    "Salt and 1 Seasoning Cube",
  ],
  instructions: [
    {
      point: "Submerge abacha in hot water water in a bowl and set aside.",
    },
    {
      point:
        "In another bowl pour palm oil. Dissolve 1.5 tablespoons of akanwu with 1/4 cup of water.",
    },
    {
      note: "If your akanwu is in solid form and not powder, add a little extra water and allow it to dissolve.",
    },
    {
      point:
        "Add the akanwu water to the palm oil until the oil thickens and turns to a lighter shade of orange.",
    },
    {
      note: "Be careful with how much akanwu you add especially if you have plans for later, it is a known laxative.",
    },
    {
      point:
        "Add salt, pepper, crayfish, seasoning cube and efura and mix properly.",
    },
    {
      note: "If you are using ponmo and/or dried shrimps, add it now as well. It is always easy to season your oil and get a proper distribution than to do it afterwards.",
    },
    {
      point: "Add the drained abacha, ugba and okazi into the oil.",
    },
    {
      point: "Mix properly until fully coated. Taste for seasoning.",
    },
    {
      point:
        "Serve with fried or smoked fish and fresh sliced onions and enjoy!",
    },
    {
      point: "The only thing missing was a tall glass of cold palm wine...",
    },

    {
      note: "Updated this post with Abacha without okazi in it, ponmo and dreid shrimps added to the sauce and topped with a little utazi. Utazi is bitter, so don't overdo it.",
    },
  ],
